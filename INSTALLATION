Installation Procedure for the ConsensLib C++ Library

Please note that this is a header only C++ library.
You can directly use the header files in the folder `include`.
However, the tests must be built
using the instructions given in this document.

This library needs a C++-14 compiler!

This package uses CMake for the build process. See
the [CMake documentation] (https://cmake.org/documentation/)
for general configuration options.

The most useful option is `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<your/target/path>` for changing
the install directory.

Core library
============

Prerequisites
-------------

The build process needs [CMake] (https://cmake.org) (>= 3.1) and a C++-14 compiler
(for example g++, clang++ or MSVC).


Installation Unix and macOS
---------------------------

Installation on Unix using `make` and the system's default C++ compiler.

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make && make install

Test
----

Use the following command to test the build
of the core library. Testing is strongly recommended.

    make test

The program will execute the subgraph enumeration on different graph data structures
with a range of parameterisations.


Installation Windows
--------------------

Installation on Windows using the `Visual Studio` C++ compiler and
`MSBuild.exe` from the command line (`cmd.exe`).
Replace `Visual Studio 15 2017` by your Version.

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake.exe -G"Visual Studio 15 2017" ..
    MSBuild.exe ALL_BUILD.vcxproj /property:Configuration=Release
    MSBuild.exe INSTALL.vcxproj /property:Configuration=Release

Use the following command to test the build
of the core library.

MSBuild.exe RUN_TESTS.vcxproj /property:Configuration=Release
